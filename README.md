# neSparkleComponent
neSparkleComponent is a FireMonkey component for Delphi. It adds update functionality similar to Sparkle for OSX. The componet is a wrapper for the WinSparkle framework.


#Foundations
neSparkleComponent is based on the excellent work of Václav Slavík and his project WinSparkle, which can be found here: [WinSparkle Project](http://winsparkle.org "WinSparkle Project")


#How To Use
1. Build and install the package: Open the Package file and install the component. Add the source code path to the Search Path of the project or the library in the IDE

2. Install the component using the installer. The installer will update the search paths of the IDE


# Platforms
This is a FireMonkey component. For now it implements access to Win32 and Win64. The intention is to write bindings for OSX, too.


#Documentation
There is documentation about the classes, the methods and properties. Please check the "Documentation" folder.
